# Loopstudio React Web Project

This project is a landing page built with react following the react course which I'm currently taking.
This is my first main project completed with react and built properly with react features, some of them like:

## using the power of props to the best of my knowledge

## a little bit of conditional rendering

## and then finally state management.

It was really fun while it lasted.
Moving on the next level in react.
